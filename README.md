# formik-form
This formik-form exercise contains code for setting up a basic Formik form with email and password input fields. It is set up to report errors and prevent submission
if either field is left empty or if text is entered into the email field that isn't in email format. If all requirements are met, an alert saying "Login Successful" will
show up when the form is submitted.

## How to Run
In order to run this code after cloning the repo, run `npm install` and `npm start`.
